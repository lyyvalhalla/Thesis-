Revisit -- A Bookmark Biography

Revisit is a web-based experience that uses your bookmarks to create a personalized and explorable visual timeline of your life, work, and quantified self data.

Description:
You may have hundreds or thousands of bookmarks. You may have wanted to read this collection of things, page by page, as a book of your knowledge growth. You may fail to do so, because of lack of time or energy, and surplus of information. This project creates an interactive story of you, using your once picked and collected—but later somehow neglected, avoided or forgotten—data. It explores the idea that bookmarks are meaningful memories - small pieces of information that reveal insights about your life journey. Revisit will help you see your knowledge grow through bookmarking, and reflect on yourself in terms of the Internet wisdom.
